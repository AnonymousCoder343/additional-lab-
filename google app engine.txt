Aim: Assignment to install and configure Google App Engine.

Theory:
Google App Engine is a web application hosting service. By “web application,” we mean
an application or service accessed over the Web, usually with a web browser: storefronts with
shopping carts, social networking sites, multiplayer games, mobile applications, survey
applications, project management, collaboration, publishing, and all the other things we’re
discovering are good uses for the Web.

Google App Engine:
It is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) Cloud computing platform that is fully managed and
uses inbuilt services to run your apps. You can start development almost instantly after
downloading the software development kit (SDK). You can go on to the developer’s guide right
away when you click on the language you wish to develop your app in.

Advantages of Google App Engine:
• Infrastructure for Security
• Scalability
• Performance and Reliability
• Cost Savings
• Platform Independence
